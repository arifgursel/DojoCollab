# Dojo Collab Directory

The goal of this repo is for us to practice using git terminal commands and GitHub. 

Your Actions
============
1. Create a folder on your local machine
2. Clone this repo into that folder
3. Create a new branch
4. Add your information to our class directory in that new branch
	HINT: There's some comments in the index.html file, at a bare minimum just follow those!
4. Merge your working branch into your master branch
6. Send a pull request to merge your changes into the GitHub repo
7. TAG THE WALL: Add your name to this file below to signal you are Git'n ready for the dev world (enough geek jokes)

*** NOTE: Instructions purposely left vague, refer to dojo material to figure out how to do any of this. 

****** IMPORTANT: You can't screw anything up whatsoever that matters so have fun learning and lets all learn together. :)
